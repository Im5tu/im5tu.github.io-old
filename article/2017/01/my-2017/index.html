I know that I&rsquo;m massively late to the 2017 blog post party, but I didn&rsquo;t really think about it for quite a while. I wanted to refocus and find out what I really wanted to achieve rather than a token guesture that would likely fail like previously. I&rsquo;ve split this out into two main categories below: Personal and Professional Development.</p><h2 id=personal-development>Personal Development</h2><h3 id=health--fitness>Health & Fitness</h3><p>This is my primary goal for 2017. I&rsquo;ll be honest and say that 2015 & 2016 wasn&rsquo;t exactly the greatest for me. So much so, I acquired the name &ldquo;the feeder&rdquo; at my previous job. I was always eating. As we all know, eating & a sedentary job means weight gain. I topped out at 106kg approximately. For me, as a former athlete, this was massive.</p><p>Starting off just after Christmas, I purchased both a Fitbit Charge 2 and the Fitbit Aria to begin my transformation (I&rsquo;ll post my thoughts on these products soon). I am tracking as much data as I can including water/food consumption, weight/body fat and mood. With all the data, I hope to make small adjustments (heklo agile!) rather than big shocking changes that i&rsquo;ve previously made. Exercise is not the biggest part of this, it&rsquo;s the nutrional side. So far this month, I have seen a big change. I haven&rsquo;t been as on plan as I would have liked, but I am correcting this day by day and trying to make healthier choices.</p><h3 id=linguistics>Linguistics</h3><p>For me, the goal of linguistics falls into two parts: writing and foreign languages. As I blog more throughout the year, I know that my writing will naturally improve as and when I get feedback on posts. As I begin to read more books, i&rsquo;ll learn new and exciting words/phrases that will aid with this also.</p><p>As a British person, I am always amazed everytime that I travel to a different country. Nearly everyone seems to be able to speak English, but we (myself included) cannot return the pleasantaries. So for this aim, i&rsquo;ve downloaded and began using an app called Duolingo to begin learning Dutch. Why Dutch? I seem to be there every year now for dance events so it would be nice to speak the language as to not be so ignorant when I travel. I&rsquo;m off there again next month, so I highly doubt i&rsquo;ll be able to say anything useful, but i&rsquo;m putting in a solid shift with the aim of being able to order some food in Dutch.</p><h3 id=mentality>Mentality</h3><p>The above two goals require a strong mindset as there will be the enevitible ups and downs. For this, I have taken inspiration from the likes of <a href=https://twitter.com/jockowillink>Jocko Willink</a>. Jocko is co-author of a book called Extreme Ownership and hosts his own podcast. The podcast is what has been the primary driver behind the changes that I am making. One particular aspect that I liked is when Jocko was talking about a person failing in a situation when he was in the seal teams, to which he responded with &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;. Why good? Well, out of every bad situation comes a chance to learn and progress not only yourselves, but potentially others. Taking a positive spin on everything can only be a good thing!</p><h2 id=professional-development>Professional Development</h2><h3 id=social>Social</h3><p>I fail at this level in so many ways. If I can just be consistent with getting back to people on LinkedIn, writing more consistently and posting relevant, interesting content then I would be happy. I used to think that blogging was only about writing long technical articles, but there is so much more than that. I hope to open up about what i&rsquo;m doing both technical and non-technical in the coming months.</p><h3 id=work>Work</h3><p>After changing my job role towards the back end of last year, I will be looking at consolidating my position and growing within the role. It&rsquo;s my first senior role, so I am getting used to the additional responsibilities that it brings. Moreover, I have transferred from the telecommunications industry to creative. Personally, I think getting a broad set of industry experience is crucial for developers as each industry will present different challenges. It&rsquo;s also my first time working with a CMS system. Coming from a non-CMS background, some quirks have definitely caught me by surprise!</p><p>So that wraps up what I imagine 2017 to be like for me. I&rsquo;ll keep myself accountable by posting regular updates on social media and here on the blog every few months. Thanks for reading, see you again soon!</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://im5tu.io/tags/lifestyle>lifestyle</a></span><span class=tag><a href=https://im5tu.io/tags/fitness>fitness</a></span><span class=tag><a href=https://im5tu.io/tags/life>life</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>773 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2017-01-20 13:55 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h></span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://im5tu.io/article/2017/02/openmessage-1.1-released/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
