      <description>In my previous article, we setup a standarised build using the new YML build definitions within VSTS, using the .Net CLI tooling. In this article, we will use the same setup as our base, but we will build and publish a service fabric application.
Our sample build file has the following steps:
 Clean Sources Install the Dotnet CLI Restore Packages Build Projects Test Projects Publish the Web App Publish Build Artifacts Tag VSTS Build  For our service fabric build, we will need the following steps:</description>

      <description>In this article we will explore a preview feature inside of Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) called YML Build Definitions. In essence, this allows you to change your build process from a .yml file in your git repository much in the same way as you can do with other services such as AppVeyor. During the article, we will setup a build definition for an Aspnet Core website.
Prerequisites Before we take a look at the struture of the file, you will need to complete the following tasks:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will give a brief overview of cookies, why we want them to be httpOnly and how we can ensure this via URL Rewrite. We will also be creating our first outbound rewrite rule with a pre-condition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In the previous post, I gave a brief intoduction to URL Rewriting and showed you how to get from HTTP to HTTPS. In this article, I will show you how to have a canonical host url.
What is a canonical host url? It can be incredibly easy to distribute different urls for your website. Lets say that we have www.site.com/post1 and site.com/post1. If you&amp;rsquo;re a search engine, you think that these are different different pages with the same content.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this series, I am going to take you through a few &lt;code&gt;web.config&lt;/code&gt; snippets that have come in handy for me when using URL Rewrite on IIS. Firstly, I am going to introduce the URL Rewrite module then show a sample of going from HTTP to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2017/05/domain-driven-design-notes/</guid>
      <description>These are my notes on domain driven design whilst watching the course by Dino Esposito on Pluralsight.
Domain Driven Design (or DDD), is the process of discovering both data and behavioural requirements for a given problem domain where traditional approaches usually focus purely on data collection aspects. The aim is to provide better tools to tackle the complexity at the heart of software. Within DDD, there are two distinct parts: an analytical one and a strategical one.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over recent months, some close friends and I have found ourselves in a bit of a rut and woken up to the fact that we aren&amp;rsquo;t getting any younger and don&amp;rsquo;t really have a plan. Naturally, this can be upsetting to a person and it&amp;rsquo;s something that can be easily rectified. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this the first of many &lt;a href=&#34;https://im5tu.io/categories/news&#34;&gt;news roundups&lt;/a&gt;, I am going to look back through the news that you may have missed and the stories/blogs that have interested me over the previous month(s). In this round up I will be taking a look at content from arround mid January, through to the 1st March 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OpenMessage 2017 Roadmap</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/im5tu/openmessage&#34;&gt;OpenMessage&lt;/a&gt; originally started out as a replacement for an internal library that was used across teams. At the time, the team I was apart of needed the latest version of dotnet core for the library where as the other team were stuck on RC1. They were also developing features for that version of the framework and a few pre-existing details that we were unhappy with (eg: the request/response implementation). With that in mind, I created a minimal wrapper for what we needed. Looking forward, I plan to dedicate a bit more time to the project and improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick update to say that the Azure provider for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Im5tu/OpenMessage&#34;&gt;OpenMessage&lt;/a&gt; has been released. This update fixes an issue with scheduling messages on topics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about writing this post for a little while now, but never seem to get around to it. I know that I&amp;rsquo;m massively late to the 2017 blog post party, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about it for quite a while. I wanted to refocus and find out what I really wanted to achieve rather than a token guesture that would likely fail like previously. I&amp;rsquo;ve split this out into two main categories below: Personal and Professional Development.

      <title>Hugo Quick Tip: Inlining Css Files</title>
      <link>https://im5tu.io/article/2016/12/hugo-quick-tip-inlining-css-files/</link>

      <guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2016/12/hugo-quick-tip-inlining-css-files/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I have been doing a little bit of work on my site and one of the things that I wanted to do is inline the css file. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a small file anyway, and once compressed with gzip should make a fairly minimal difference to the size of the page.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a rework of a draft that I&amp;rsquo;ve had sitting in my drafts folder for a long while now. Over the last six months or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reviewing a lot more code than I had previously thanks in part to a promotion and in part, code reviewing applicants coding entries. Some of the code has been good, with some code, really not so good!

Now we need to install a theme and begin publishing. Prior to writing this series, I began evaluating the extensibility of hugo themes and started work on something I call bones - a no thrills template with no styling, just structure. As I improve the template it will become more useful, maybe. It will remain the template behind mysite as I continue to improve it.

There are many points of view on the subject covered by various people such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt&#34;&gt;Uncle Bob&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;, but I thought it might be insightful to show how my team manages our code base.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced a time where we use our pc&amp;rsquo;s for a prolonged period of time, accumulating a ton of crap along the way as we try out various technologies and fads. After a while, the pc begins to do funny things like crash for no apparent reason. This week, I needed to rebuild my dev machine and decided to change from Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s Source Tree over to Powershell and raw git.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not up-to-date, you fall behind. You fall behind in your work, which leads you to fall behind at home. If continued, it&amp;rsquo;s a never ending circle that can seem like climbing Everest in order to overcome. I propose that we, as developers, start doing is utilizing our free time to help not only ourselves but our co-workers too. We can do this via dev lunches.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MSMQ is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Message Queuing service that can be used to implement both synchronous and asynchronous solutions. Typically solutions are architectured using the available C++ API’s or via the relevant COM objects. The .Net Framework exposes the System.Messaging namespace which contains all the classes that you need to work with the MSMQ API. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Message queues are a substantial part of modern day enterprise architectures and a vital part of providing scalable solutions. They are designed for asynchronous communication between different parts of the system. They help scale individual components of a system and increase reliability with the optional addition of the persistence of messages to a storage system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I just wanted to share a quick note regarding &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/2040097/315711&#34;&gt;a Stack Overflow answer&lt;/a&gt; that I recently came across. In the answer the author explains that a call to &lt;code&gt;Expression.CanReduce&lt;/code&gt; will typically return false, while &lt;code&gt;Expression.Reduce()&lt;/code&gt; will return the current expression. The author continues to state that one of the types that overrides &lt;code&gt;Expression.Reduce()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Expression.CanReduce&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;MemberInitExpression&lt;/code&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently begun studying the theory and implementations of algorithms. During this study, I came across &lt;a href=&#34;http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; which describes how a bug exists in most implementations of a binary search algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to cover something that is not often covered when unit testing an object. If an object has the &lt;code&gt;Equals&lt;/code&gt; method overridden, then there are a number of tests that we should be running as a minimum, these are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I discussed how to &lt;a href=&#34;https://im5tu.io/article/2014/04/enabling-http-strict-transport-security-hsts-via-asp-net-mvc-actionfilters/&#34;&gt;enable HSTS via MVC Action Filters&lt;/a&gt;. I thought that I would just do a follow up post showing you how to enable it via the web.config. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

That mechanism is HTTP Strict Transport Security.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2013/05/using-idisposible-correctly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am going to show you how to use the &lt;code&gt;IDisposable&lt;/code&gt; interface correctly in your code. When I read others code, it is easy to pick up on subtle bugs. We need to begin to train ourselves to see the bugs and we do this by understanding what we are using. Before we begin, we need to make sure that we understand a core piece of computer science theory: Destructors.

      <title>Semaphore vs SeamphoreSlim Micro Benchmark</title>

      <guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2013/03/semaphore-vs-seamphoreslim-micro-benchmark/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am going to show a small micro-benchmark to demonstrate the performance difference between the &lt;code&gt;Semaphore&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SemaphoreSlim&lt;/code&gt; classes in C#. A &lt;code&gt;Semaphore&lt;/code&gt; is often used to restrict the number of threads than can access some (physical or logical) resource. In this case, we want the restriction to be as little as possible.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a project I have been working on recently, I came across a problem where under Windows an Mdi Child form would flicker when it loads. Trying to find information on what was the cause of this was near impossible. I ended up trying a lot of code snippets that I found when googling the problem and this is what I have come up with.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article we will take a look at what extension methods are and how to use them in .Net. Personally, they are one of the best things that has been introduced into the .Net framework in terms of readability. I will take you through what extension methods are, how to create them (in c# and vb) then I will show you some of the extension methods that I have created (in c# only, conversion is for you to try).
