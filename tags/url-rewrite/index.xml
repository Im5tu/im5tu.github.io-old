      <description>In the previous post, I gave a brief intoduction to URL Rewriting and showed you how to get from HTTP to HTTPS. In this article, I will show you how to have a canonical host url.
What is a canonical host url? It can be incredibly easy to distribute different urls for your website. Lets say that we have www.site.com/post1 and site.com/post1. If you&#39;re a search engine, you think that these are different different pages with the same content.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this series, I am going to take you through a few &lt;code&gt;web.config&lt;/code&gt; snippets that have come in handy for me when using URL Rewrite on IIS. Firstly, I am going to introduce the URL Rewrite module then show a sample of going from HTTP to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
