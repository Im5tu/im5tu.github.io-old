Occasionally, you will have an interface that you wish to mock out with Moq and find you have troubles because the method signature takes a &lt;code>ref&lt;/code> or an &lt;code>out&lt;/code> parameter. This week, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way that we can successfully mock the method without too much of a change to the test code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setting Up A Repository Template In Github For .Net</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/10/setting-up-a-repository-template-in-github-for-.net/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 17:45:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/10/setting-up-a-repository-template-in-github-for-.net/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been updating some of my projects to latest standards, adding in Github Actions where appropriate etc. Most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve setup a template repository in Github.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Implementing Simple Feature Toggles In AspNetCore Using IConfiguration</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/08/implementing-simple-feature-toggles-in-aspnetcore-using-iconfiguration/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2020 11:45:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/08/implementing-simple-feature-toggles-in-aspnetcore-using-iconfiguration/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, we&amp;rsquo;ve had the need to build a few feature toggles in our applications that can be changed at runtime.

This article takes a look at how we can embed the tooling that we require into the image so that we extract the counter/memory information as required. This approach does not require elevated permissions as before.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: Listening to inbound HTTP requests</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/06/diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-listening-to-inbound-http-requests/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/06/diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-listening-to-inbound-http-requests/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my &lt;a href="https://im5tu.io/article/2020/06/diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-listening-to-outbound-http-requests/">previous article&lt;/a> we took a look at how to monitor outbound HTTP requests using a &lt;code>DiagnosticListener&lt;/code>. In this article, we will re-use some of the same components to monitor inbound HTTP requests. We could use middleware to do as most approaches do, but this approach is highly dependent on the middleware that you have and the duration of this, so we will re-use some of the code from last time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: Listening to outbound HTTP requests</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/06/diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-listening-to-outbound-http-requests/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 01:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/06/diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-listening-to-outbound-http-requests/</guid><description>&lt;p>Throughout the course of my Diagnostics in .Net Core series, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken a look at the basics of how to use the Event Counters API.

Now, the project does already ship with some media formatters as a separate nuget package.

At the time, the team I was apart of needed the latest version of dotnet core for the library where as the other team were stuck on RC1. They were also developing features for that version of the framework and a few pre-existing details that we were unhappy with (eg: the request/response implementation). With that in mind, I created a minimal wrapper for what we needed. Looking forward, I plan to dedicate a bit more time to the project and improve it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OpenMessage 1.1 Released</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2017/02/openmessage-1.1-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2017 15:31:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2017/02/openmessage-1.1-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just a quick update to say that the Azure provider for &lt;a href="https://github.com/Im5tu/OpenMessage">OpenMessage&lt;/a> has been released.
