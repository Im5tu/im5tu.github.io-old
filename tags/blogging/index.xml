      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will show you how the theme has been constructed and show you how the overrides work. So far we have created a site, setup most of our workflow and posted our first article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://im5tu.io/article/2016/11/blog-building---part-1---hello-hugo/&#34;&gt;the last article&lt;/a&gt;, we setup our workflow and all the pieces that you will need to create a new site. Now we need to install a theme and begin publishing. Prior to writing this series, I began evaluating the extensibility of hugo themes and started work on something I call bones - a no thrills template with no styling, just structure. As I improve the template it will become more useful, maybe. It will remain the template behind mysite as I continue to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello World. Safe to say it&#39;s been a little while since I have blogged or even had a website come to think of it. Alas, I am back with some fresh ideas and recharged to help you dear reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
