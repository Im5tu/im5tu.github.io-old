      <description>In the previous post, I gave a brief intoduction to URL Rewriting and showed you how to get from HTTP to HTTPS. In this article, I will show you how to have a canonical host url.
What is a canonical host url? It can be incredibly easy to distribute different urls for your website. Lets say that we have www.site.com/post1 and site.com/post1. If you&amp;rsquo;re a search engine, you think that these are different different pages with the same content.</description>
