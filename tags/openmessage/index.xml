At the time, the team I was apart of needed the latest version of dotnet core for the library where as the other team were stuck on RC1. They were also developing features for that version of the framework and a few pre-existing details that we were unhappy with (eg: the request/response implementation). With that in mind, I created a minimal wrapper for what we needed. Looking forward, I plan to dedicate a bit more time to the project and improve it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OpenMessage 1.1 Released</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2017/02/openmessage-1.1-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2017 15:31:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2017/02/openmessage-1.1-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just a quick update to say that the Azure provider for &lt;a href="https://github.com/Im5tu/OpenMessage">OpenMessage&lt;/a> has been released.
